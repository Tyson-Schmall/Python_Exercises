These files contain a number of exercises and basics learned and practiced throughout the Python section of my class.
Each individual exercise or function, build, etc, is commented out in the form of a multiline string.
The standard commented-out lines of code describe, very explicitly, the code blocks and what purpose they serve.

Leave '# Descriptive comments', remove ' """ ' from atop and below a block of code to have it display and be ready to run.

This was all done in VS-Code.
